## Battleship

_Practicing TDD in Javascript by recreating the game of Battleship._

Made with React

* Check it out [here](https://pudu87.github.io/battleship/)
* From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship)

### Features

* Draggable ships for setup
* Semi-intelligent AI (keeps shooting adjacent cells after a hit)

### Issues

* Official rules state that ships cannot be adjacent, but this is not implemented here. Also, I never played it like that
* Design is not responsive, don't play it on your smartphone
